	//Constructor :-
	
	// Constructor name must be the same as its class name.
	// Constructor cannot be abstract, static, final, and synchronized.(Need Explanation)
	// Constructor must not have return type. 
	// Constructor always used or called when we are creating object.
	// When constructor doesn't have any parameter then it is known as Default constructor.
	// Default Constructor is also known as Non-Parameterized Constructor.
	// Default Constructor is used to provide the default values to the object like 0, null, etc.
	// Constructor which has a specific parameters is called a parameterized constructor.
